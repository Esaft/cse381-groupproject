Larry the Lumberjack lived a serene life, cutting down the evergrowing trees around his hilltop log cabin,
and rolling them down the incline to awaiting customers.

Then everything changed when the Ogres showed up.

Larry didn't know where they came from, or why, but one thing was certain: They wanted to destroy his happy life.
Endlessly they attempt to climb Larry's hill, and destroy his cabin. Larry has only one tool with which to stop
them: his axe.

What?! No, he doesn't attack them with his axe! That would be psychotic! No, Larry just does what he always did,
cut down trees and rolls them down his hill. However, now Larry makes sure that the Ogres just happen to be in 
the path of those logs...
